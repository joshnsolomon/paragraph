# paragraph
___________

Prints matched string inside file, but returns the entire paragraph instead of just the line.

```
paragraph [string] [path]
```

If you put the path in quotes (for example "*.txt") it will search recursively through subdirectories.

Should also highlight matching word.

you need grep, sed, and gawk (gnu awk not the regular one)
